All graphical elements in a room, must be within it's own folder by the name of the Room ID. Say you got room 3 the path for this directory would be:
"/Graphics/3"
Note that the player - being consistent through all rooms/scenes - is not stored in this manner. More info below.

To make quick procedual work of this, each "entity" in a scene (room) has a specific name as to be able to access these easily.
In order of significanse to the scene:
Name:   What it is:                                                                     File Info:
BASE    A 1000 by 1500 picture that is the foundation of the scene (room) top down.     PNG     ("/Graphics/x/BASE.png")
MIDDLE  A 1000 by 1500 picture that shows the interiors of any rooms.                   PNG     ("/Graphics/x/MIDDLE.png")
SHADOW  A 1000 by 1500 picture that contains the shadows from walls and such            PNG     ("/Graphics/x/SHADOW.png")
TOP     A 1000 by 1500 picture that shows rooftops, tree-tops, clouds.                  PNG     ("/Graphics/x/TOP.png")

NB: DO KEEP IN MIND that Renderlayer4 (TOP) is also used for some parts of UI!

/Graphics/Player/
Contains 4 directories: North, South, East & West. These directories contains the walking animations (or still frames) of the player moving in these directions.
To access these efficiently you'd load them into the Player class which impliments Renderable as 4 BufferedImage arrays.
More directories can be added later for additional animations.

/Graphics/CItem
Contains a LOT of pictures which filename corresponds to the Item ID, but also contains cItemPositions.csv

/Graphics/CItem/cItemPositions.csv
Syntax:
<Item ID>,<X-coordinate>,<Y-coordinate>
