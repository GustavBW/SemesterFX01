RULES OF THE GIT
 - Fetch before you start doing anything and commit as the very last thing you do.
 - If you need to edit code NOT written by you, contact the person responsible for it BEFORE commiting it. 
 - DO NOT COMMIT before making sure your changes wont fuck up everything
 - Do consult the Trello every once in a while. You might not be aware of what is needed for your task. 
 - DO NOT COMMIT COMPILE ERRORS! Check yourself before you wreck yourself.
 - Always add a describtion to your commit containing a short summary of what you've done. Try make a title that is understandable
 - Avoid commiting before the piece of functionality is complete - unless someone needs you to. 

GIT GUD


RULES OF THE COD
 - Always make sure to make comments in the code detailing what is going on. Might seem irrellevant at times, but in 2 months? - it sure as hell aint.
 - Variable names should be understandable before being neat and compact. 
 - When debugging using println - please remove it afterwards (not just comment it out - it gets messy)
 - Non-final variables, functions/Methods and instances of classes are camelCase.
 - Constants / final variables are HYPECASE.


LEGEND OF THE COD
 - Pos = Position
 - Val = Value
 - X,Y = coordinates on screen. If it aint that, call it something else.
 - Temp = Temporary
 - Obj = Object
 - Arr = Array
 - Pl = Player
 - V = Vector (e.g. vPlEn = Vector from Player to Enemy)
//Update this and commit whenever a change is decided upon.
